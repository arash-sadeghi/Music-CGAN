## TODO
- [ ] integrate WandB.
- [ ] after model is trained, make a runner version:
    - [ ] either bundle it to .exe and get input track from a txt file or put in a react app or sth.
- [ ] current version works offline with a given midi file. In next version I will make it run realtime.
    - [ ] make it lear drum track for next time step. for now use looping
